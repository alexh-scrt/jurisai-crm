## Project Context Summary

### What We're Building
**Secret AI Rails** — an execution infrastructure that enables AI to act (not just assist) with three guarantees:
1. **Trust** — Policy-governed, controlled execution
2. **Proof** — Every action verifiable and auditable
3. **Confidentiality** — Data protected even during processing

### Our Unique Position
- **Existing production platform**: Web portal for confidential/non-confidential VMs (like AWS EC2/Azure)
- **Technical expertise**: Intel TDX, AMD SEV, NVIDIA H100 CC, blockchain KMS, ledger systems
- **Current customers**: SMBs deploying Docker Compose applications to confidential infrastructure
- **Pilot commitments**: 2-3 SMB pilots + MIT partnership

### Strategic Thesis
> "Trust — not intelligence — is the bottleneck to AI adoption. We remove that bottleneck."

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Target Market** | SMBs first, then mid-market/enterprise | Faster sales cycles, prove value, expand |
| **V1 Scope** | Business communications automation | High volume, clear ROI, manageable complexity |
| **Pricing Model** | Tiered subscription + usage | Predictable revenue + scales with usage |
| **Differentiation** | Vertical integration (own the stack) | Cost advantage, control, no dependencies |
| **Go-to-Market** | Existing customers → New SMBs → Enterprise | Built-in distribution, prove before scaling |

|------|---------|--------|
| Starter | $99 | Micro-business |
| Growth | $499 | SMB |
| Scale | $1,499 | Growing SMB |
| Enterprise | Custom | Mid-market+ |

### 3-Year Projections (Base Case)
| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Ending ARR | $600K | $3.5M | $10.4M |
| Customers | 70 | 320 | 850 |
| Gross Margin | 75% | 77% | 80% |

### Funding Ask

## Key Messages (Quick Reference)

### One-Liner
> "Secret AI Rails is the execution layer that allows enterprises to finally let AI do the work."

### For VCs
> "We already run a confidential cloud platform. AI Rails turns it into the execution layer for enterprise AI — and we own the full stack."

### For Customers
> "Build AI applications that automate your operations — on infrastructure that keeps your data private and proves every action."

### For Technical Buyers
> "Per-workflow CVMs on TDX/SEV, H100 CC for inference, blockchain-backed KMS, append-only proof ledger. We own the stack."
