# JurisAI-CRM - Investor Pitch

A Universal CRM Platform on AI Rails

Starting with Legal

⸻

1. The Problem

CRMs across industries were designed to store information and automate steps, not to understand complex, regulated work.

In legal, this limitation is acute:
	•	Cases are document-heavy and knowledge-intensive
	•	Workflows depend on judgment, not just procedure
	•	Decisions must be explainable, auditable, and defensible
	•	AI tools exist, but are disconnected from case state and accountability

Today’s reality:
	•	Case management systems track matters but do not understand them
	•	Legal AI tools draft and research but lack workflow control and auditability
	•	Expertise lives in people’s heads and is repeatedly re-created
	•	Firms juggle multiple systems with no single source of truth

As a result, legal professionals spend disproportionate time:
	•	reconstructing case understanding,
	•	supervising routine work,
	•	coordinating tools,
	•	and defending AI-assisted decisions after the fact.

This is not a tooling problem.
It is an architectural one.

⸻

2. The Insight

CRM should be a system of reasoning and execution, not just a system of record.

JurisAI is built on a simple but radical idea:

AI should be the core operating layer of the CRM, governing knowledge, workflows, and decisions.

This architecture is universal—but legal is the perfect place to start.

⸻

3. The Solution: JurisAI

JurisAI is a universal CRM platform on AI rails where:
	•	AI maintains a living understanding of work
	•	Workflows encode domain expertise
	•	UI guides users step by step
	•	Every AI-assisted action is auditable

Instead of customizing a generic CRM, customers deploy domain-specific CRMs built from component packs.

Legal is the first component pack.

⸻

4. What Makes JurisAI Different

4.1 CRM becomes a living case model

JurisAI continuously maintains:
	•	extracted facts and timelines,
	•	identified legal issues,
	•	missing information checklists,
	•	strength and completeness assessments,
	•	linked research and authorities.

The system understands the case—not just stores it.

⸻

4.2 AI is governed infrastructure, not a feature

In JurisAI:
	•	AI is explicit and optional per component
	•	Every AI call is grounded, metered, and logged
	•	No AI action changes state without human approval
	•	Outputs are traceable to sources

This makes AI safe for regulated, high-stakes work.

⸻

4.3 Workflows become executable expertise

Workflows in JurisAI encode:
	•	reasoning steps,
	•	AI analysis,
	•	human judgment gates,
	•	domain-specific UI guidance.

When deployed, a workflow becomes a complete CRM application running in an isolated environment.

⸻

4.4 UI teaches, guides, and reduces expertise gaps

JurisAI:
	•	explains what to do next and why,
	•	highlights risks and missing information,
	•	enables junior consultants to work safely under supervision.

The system does the hard work; the professional makes decisions.

⸻

4.5 Auditability is built-in

JurisAI includes an immutable audit ledger that records:
	•	AI inputs and outputs,
	•	sources and citations,
	•	human approvals and overrides,
	•	workflow decisions and case outcomes.

This is essential for trust, compliance, and enterprise adoption.

⸻

5. Why Legal First

Legal is:
	•	document-heavy
	•	rule-based but judgment-driven
	•	regulated and audit-sensitive
	•	expensive to get wrong

If JurisAI works for legal, it works for any regulated, knowledge-intensive domain.

Legal is not the market cap—it is the proof point.

⸻

7. Revised POC Scope (Legal Pack v1)

Goal

Demonstrate a complete, AI-native legal CRM with a clear “wow moment.”

In scope
	•	Workflow Studio (v1)
	•	Legal Component Pack v1
	•	Deployed CRM instance (isolated)
	•	Case Workspace UI
	•	Document upload + analysis
	•	“Assess Case” pipeline
	•	Research + citations (basic)
	•	Draft memo + client email
	•	Human approval gates
	•	Audit ledger + AI usage view

Out of scope (for POC)
	•	Multi-jurisdiction breadth
	•	Court filing integrations
	•	Advanced calendaring rules
	•	Cross-tenant learning

⸻

8. The “Wow Moment” (Investor Demo)
	1.	Upload raw case documents
	2.	Click Assess Case
	3.	JurisAI produces:
	•	case summary and timeline
	•	identified issues and missing information
	•	strength/completeness assessment
	•	relevant case law with citations
	4.	One click:
	•	generate a client email requesting missing items
	•	generate a first draft legal memo
	5.	Show:
	•	audit trail
	•	AI usage and approvals
	•	workflow-driven UI

This demonstrates something investors rarely see:

AI doing real, accountable work inside a governed system.

⸻

9. Big Picture

JurisAI is not a legal CRM.

It is a universal CRM platform where:
	•	AI is the operating layer,
	•	expertise is encoded as workflows,
	•	and domains are unlocked through component packs.

Legal is the beginning.

⸻

10. Closing Positioning

JurisAI turns complex, regulated work into executable, auditable software—starting with legal, extending everywhere.
